# FlutterDevlopment
This repository is a record of my journey learning Flutter development from scratch!  I'm a complete beginner with no prior experience, so follow along as I build simple apps and experiment with the framework.
This repository will contain code for various small projects I create while learning Flutter.  Expect to see:

->Basic UI elements (buttons, text fields, etc.)

->Working with Layouts (Rows, Columns, Stacks, etc.)

->State Management (Simple examples)

->User Interaction and Functionality

->Maybe even some basic Animations!
